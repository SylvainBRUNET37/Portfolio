        I'm a French computer science student specializing in video game programming, currently studying in Montreal, Canada. 
        I have a strong interest in C++, software architecture and performance optimization. 
        I actively follow the field by watching technical conferences and by regularly reading computer science books.
        I'm currently seeking a final-year internship starting in May 2026 or later.
